        A new, more robust implementation of locally valid simple cover
        cuts was included in the MIP solver.

        * src/draft/ios.h, src/draft/glpios01.c, src/draft/glpios03.c
        These modules were changed to use the new cover cut generator.

        * src/misc/ks.c, src/misc/ks.h

        * GLPK 4.64 (42:3:2) has been released.

        * src/simplex/spydual.c
        The internal routine play_coef of the dual simplex solver was
        changed to perform more aggressive perturbation to prevent dual
        degeneracy and avoid stalling even if the current dual basic
        solution is strongly feasible (mainly if the objective is zero,
        so all reduced costs are always zero). Thanks to David Monniaux
        <David.Monniaux@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr> for bug report.

        * src/draft/glpssx.h, glpssx02.c, glpapi07.c
        The exact simplex solver routines were changed to perform
        terminal output according to the verbosity level (specified by
        the control parameter smcp.msg_lev). Thanks to Jeroen Demeyer
        <jdemeyer@cage.ugent.be> for bug report.

        * src/simplex/spxchuzr.c
        The directive #include <config.h> was added. Thanks to Heinrich
        Schuchardt <xypron.glpk@gmx.de> for bug report.

        Three example models in MathProg and one in Cplex LP format
        were added. Thanks to Peter Naszvadi <vuk@cs.elte.hu> for
        contribution.

Tue Jul 25 12:00:00 2017 Andrew Makhorin <mao@gnu.org>

        * GLPK 4.63 (42:2:2) has been released.

        * src/simplex/spxchuzr.h, src/simplex/spxchuzr.c

        included in the primal simplex solver.

        * src/simplex/spxprim.c, src/simplex/spydual.c
        An internal scaling of the objective coefficients was added to
        the primal and dual simplex solvers.

        * src/simplex/spxprim.c
        A minor bug was fixed (correction of flags of fixed non-basic
        variables after removing the perturbation).

        * src/glpk.h, src/glpapi06.c
        New smcp parameters were added (not documented yet):
        int excl (default: GLP_ON)
        Internal simplex solver option:
        GLP_ON  - exclude fixed non-basic variables from the working LP;
        GLP_OFF - keep original variables in the working LP.
        int shift (default: GLP_ON)
        Internal simplex solver option:
        GLP_ON  - shift bounds of variables in the working LP tow. zero;
        GLP_OFF - keep original bounds of variables in the working LP.
        int aorn (default: GLP_USE_NT)
        Internal simplex solver option:
        GLP_USE_AT - use A matrix in sparse row-wise format;
        GLP_USE_NT - use N matrix in sparse row-wise format.
        Parameter out_frq was changed to specify the output frequency
        in milliseconds rather than in simplex iterations.

        src/env/time.c
        The Posix version of glp_time was replaced by new one, which
        doesn't use gmtime functions to improve portability. Thanks to
        Rob Schroeder <Rob.Schroeder@graphicpkg.com> for bug report.

        src/spv.c, src/spv.h
        These files were moved to src/cglib/, since they are used only
        in the MIR cuts generator.

        examples/life_goe.mod, examples/tiling.mod, examples/toto.mod
        Three new example models in MathProg were added. Thanks to

        Calls to non-thread-safe functions gmtime, strerror, and strtok
        were replaced by calls to corresponding thread-safe equivalents
        (gmtime_r, strerror_r, and strtok_r for GNU/Linux).

        * w32/*.def, w64/*.def
        glp_config symbol was added. Thanks to Heinrich Schuchardt
        <xypron.glpk@gmx.de> for bug report.

        <cmatraki@gmail.com> for patch.

        * doc/gmpl_es.tex, doc/gmpl_es.pdf
        A new version of the document "Modeling Language GNU MathProg"
        in Spanish was included (in LaTeX and pdf formats). Thanks to
        Pablo Yapura <ypf@agro.unlp.edu.ar> for contribution.

        * configure.ac
        A check to determine if libtool needs '-no-undefined' flag to
        build shared libraries on some platforms was added.
        Thanks to Marco Atzeri <marco.atzeri@gmail.com> and Heinrich
        Schuchardt <xypron.glpk@gmx.de> for suggestion.

Sun Nov 08 12:00:00 2015 Andrew Makhorin <mao@gnu.org>

        * GLPK 4.57 (38:0:2) has been released.

        * src/simplex/spy*.*
        New, more efficient implementation of the dual simplex method
        was included in the package.

        * src/simplex/spxprim.c
        Incorrect directive #ifdef USE_AT was changed to #if USE_AT.

        * src/simplex/simplex.h
        New header for simplex-based drivers was added.

        * src/glpspx02.c
        Old implementation of the dual simplex method was removed from
        the package.

        * src/glpspx.h
        Old header for simplex-based drivers was removed.

        * src/glpapi06.c
        Call to spx_dual was changed to spy_dual.
        tol_piv = 1e-10 in glp_init_smcp was changed to 1e-9 (this new
        tolerance seems to be more adequate for new implementations of
        the primal and dual simplex methods).

        * src/glpk.h, src/glpapi09.c, src/glpios03.c
        Option iocp.sr_heur to enable/disable simple rounding heuristic
        was added. Thanks to Chris Matrakidis <cmatraki@gmail.com> for
        suggestion.

        * src/env/env.h src/env/error.c
        API routine glp_at_error was added and documented. Thanks to
        Jeroen Demeyer <jdemeyer@cage.ugent.be> for suggestion.

        * src/glpapi19.c
        Translation of MiniSat solver (src/minisat) from C++ to C is
        made by a non-skilled programmer who converts pointers to ints
        and vice versa, so MiniSat works on 32-bit platforms only.
        Fixing this portability issue would require rewriting the code,
        so currently to prevent crashing the API routine glp_minisat1
        was changed just to report failure if 64-bit version of GLPK is
        used. Thanks to Heinrich Schuchardt <xypron.glpk@gmx.de> for
        bug report.

        * doc/glpk.tex, doc/gmpl.tex
        Some material was added according to changes in GLPK API.
        Also some minor typos were corrected. Thanks to Anton Voropaev
        <anton.n.voropaev@gmail.com> for typo report.

        * w32/makefiles, w64/makefiles
        Option /Zi was added to pass to MSVC compiler.

        examples/tsp/*.*
        An example application program TSPSOL was added. This program
        is intended to solve the Symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem.
        For more details see examples/tsp/README.

        from the package.

        * src/bflib/sgf.c
        A bug was fixed in routine sgf_reduce_nuc. (The bug appeared if
        the basis matrix was structurally singular.) Thanks to Martin
        Jacob <mj@bahntechnik.de> for bug report.

        * w32/*.*, w64/*.*
        Scripts to build GLPK with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 were
        added. Thanks to Xypron <xypron.glpk@gmx.de> for contribution
        and testing.

        * src/bflib/fhvint.c, src/bflib/fhvint.h
        The routine fhvint_estimate was added to estimate 1-norm of the
        basis matrix inverse (FHV-factorization).

        * src/bflib/scfint.c, src/bflib/scfint.h
        The routine scfint_estimate was added to estimate 1-norm of the

        The prefix '_glp' was added to keep the namespace clean.

        * src/env/stream.c
        Two open modes "a" and "ab" were added. Thanks to Pedro P. Wong
        <d00604@taipower.com.tw> for bug report.

        * src/glpapi21.c (glpsol)
        Minor bug was fixed (command-line options --btf, --cbg, --cgr
        didn't work properly).

        * src/bflib/sgf.c
        A serious bug was fixed in a basis factorization routine used
        on the dense phase. (The bug might appear only if the number of
        rows exceeded sqrt(2**31) ~= 46,340 and caused access violtaion
        exception because of integer overflow.) Thanks to Mark Meketon
        <Marc.Meketon@oliverwyman.com> for bug report.

        * doc/glpk.tex
        Two API routines glp_alloc and glp_realloc were documented.

        * src/bflib/btf.h, btf.c, btfint.h, btfint.c
        The module BTF was added to the package. It implements sparse
        block triangular factorization of a square non-singular matrix

        The API routine glp_adv_basis that constructs advanced initial
        LP basis was replaced by an improved version, which (unlike the
        old version) takes into account numerical values of constraint
        coefficients.

        * src/proxy/*
        Routines that implement the proximity search heuristic for MIP
        were added. Thanks to Giorgio Sartor <0gioker0@gmail.com> for
        contribution.

        * src/glpios10.c
        A bug was fixed that caused numerical instability in the FPUMP
        heuristic (the bug was introduced in glpk 4.40).

        Some typos were corrected.
        Thanks to Jeffrey Kantor <Kantor.1@nd.edu> for report.

        * src/glprlx.c
        A serious bug was *tentatively* fixed. This bug is inherited
        from the original Fortran version of the RELAX-IV code.
        Unfortunately, the code is very intricate, so this bug is still
        under investigation. Thanks to Sylvain Fournier for bug report.

        RELAX-IV bug details
        --------------------
        In the original RELAX-IV code there are four similar fragments
        in subroutines ascnt1 and ascnt2 like this:

        C
        C     DECREASE THE PRICES OF THE SCANNED NODES BY DELPRC.
        C     ADJUST FLOW TO MAINTAIN COMPLEMENTARY SLACKNESS WITH
        C     THE PRICES.
        C
              NB = 0
              DO 6 I=1,NSAVE
              . . .
                    IF (RC(ARC).EQ.0) THEN
                      DELX=DELX+U(ARC)
                      NB = NB + 1
                      PRDCSR(NB) = ARC
                    END IF
              . . .

        On some instances the variable NB becomes greater than N (the
        number of nodes) that leads to indexing error, because the
        array PRDCSR is declared as array of N elements (more
        precisely, as array of MAXNN elements, however, NB becomes even
        much greater than MAXNN).

        (via the command-line option --pcost). This heuristic may be
        useful on solving hard MIP instances.

        * glpios03.c
        The branching heuristic by Driebeck and Tomlin (used in the
        MIP solver by default) was changed to switch to branching on
        most fractional variable if an lower bound of degradation of
        the objective is close to zero for all branching candidates.

        API routine glp_ipt_status may return two new statuses due to
        changes in glp_interior.

        * glpsol.c
        New command-line options were added (ordering algorithm used in
        the interior-point solver).

        * amd/*.*, colamd/*.*

Fri Oct 03 12:00:00 2008 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 4.32 (17:0:17) has been released

        * glpmpl01.c
        A bug was fixed. Due to this bug iterated expressions having
        an indexing expression whose dummy indices are bound to some
        values, i.e. like sum{(i+1,j,k-1) in E} x[i,j,k] are evaluated
        incorrectly. Namely, current value of such expressions is not
        invalidated when corresponding dummy indices (like i and k in
        the example above) are changed, that erroneously results in the
        same value evaluated for the first time.

        * glpios03.c
        Euclidean reduction of the local objective bound was added in
        the routine glpios03.c.

        * glpapi11.c
        The following new branch-and-cut API routines were added:
        glp_ios_row_attr      determine additional row attributes;
        glp_ios_pool_size     determine current size of the cut pool;
        glp_ios_add_row       add constraint to the cut pool;
        glp_ios_del_row       delete constraint from the cut pool;
        glp_ios_clear_pool    delete all constraints from the cut pool.

        * glpapi08.c
        The following new features were included in the branch-and-cut
        solver (the API routine glp_intopt):
        MIP presolver;
        mixed cover cut generator;
        clique cut generator.
        Due to the MIP presolver glp_intopt may additionally return
        GLP_ENOPFS and GLP_ENODFS, if primal or dual infeasibility of
        LP relaxation is detected by the presolver. Also the return
        code GLP_EMIPGAP was introduced to correctly indicate that the
        mip gap tolerance is reached.

        * glplpx01.c
        Now the obsolete API routines lpx_integer and lpx_intopt are
        completely superseded by the API routine glp_intopt that makes
        them deprecated.

        * glpmpl05.c
        Now the table driver name "iODBC" can be specified as "ODBC".

        * glpmpl03.c
        A bug fixed in the routine free_dca.
        Thanks to Xypron <xypron.glpk@gmx.de>.

        * glpsql.c
        A bug was fixed in the SQL table driver.
        Thanks to Xypron <xypron.glpk@gmx.de>.

        * examples/glpsol.c
        Changes were made to allow multiple MathProg data files.

        * doc/glpk.*
        A new edition of the GLPK reference manual was included.

        * doc/tables.*
        A new edition of the supplement "Using data tables in the GNU
        MathProg language" was included.

        implementation of the two-phase dual simplex method (spx_dual).
        Old simplex method routines (spx_prim_opt, spx_prim_feas, and
        spx_dual_opt) were removed from the package.

        * glpk.h, glpscl.h, glpscl.c, glpapi04.c

        lpx_cpx_basis which are deprecated.

        * glpdmp.c
        8-byte data alignment was added to the module (sufficient for
        both ILP32 and LP64 environments).

        * glplib07.c
        16-byte data alignment was added to the module to provide
        compatibility with LP64 environment (8-byte is not sufficient
        due to jmp_buf; thanks to Xypron for investigation).

        * glplpx16.c
        New version of the routine lpx_write_pb was added. Thanks to
        Oscar Gustafsson <oscarg@isy.liu.se> for the contribution.

        * w32/VC9, w64/VC9
        Makefiles and batch files were added to build GLPK under 32-

        * glpspx.h, glpspx03.c, glpapi06.c
        The primal simplex solver (spx_prim_opt, spx_prim_feas) was
        replaced by a new implementation (spx_primal), which currently
        provides the same features as the old version.

        * glpmpl01.c, glpmpl03.c
        Some changes were made in the MathProg translator to allow <,
        <=, >=, and > on comparing symbolic values. Thanks to Heinrich
        Schuchardt <heinrich.schuchardt@gmx.de> for patches.

        * glplpx10.c
        Internal routine set_d_eps in the exact LP solver was changed
        to prevent approximation errors in case of integral data.
        Thanks to Markus Pilz <pilz@cs.uni-bonn.de> for bug report.

Tue Mar 25 12:00:00 2008 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 4.28 (13:0:13) has been released

        * glplib.h, glplib.c
        Three wrapper routines xdlopen, xdlsym, and xdlclose, which
        provide the shared library support, were added. A particular
        version of these routines depends on the option --enable-dl
        passed to the configure script (see file INSTALL for details).
        Thanks to Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org> for useful
        advices concerning the shared library support.

        * glpsql.c
        A static linking to iODBC and MySQL libraries used in the
        MathProg table drivers was replaced by a dynamic linking to
        corresponding shared libraries.
        Many thanks to Heinrich Schuchardt <heinrich.schuchardt@gmx.de>
        for the contribution and to Vijay Patil <vijay.patil@gmail.com>
        for testing this feature under Windows XP.

        * glpgmp.h, glpgmp.c
        A bug (which appeared only on 64-bit platforms) was fixed.
        Thanks to Axel Simon <Axel.Simon@ens.fr> for the bug report.

        * glpapi.c
        A bug was fixed in the api routine glp_add_cols. (If the basis
        is valid, adding column keeps it valid, however, col->bind was
        set to -1 rather to 0.)
        Thanks to Cedric[FR] <fox2113@wanadoo.fr> for the bug report.

        * glplib.c
        64-bit unsigned int type glp_ulong and corresponding routines

        the api routine glp_mem_usage.

        * glplib.c
        Compressed data file support was added. This feature requires
        the zlib data compression libraries and allows compressing and
        decompressing .gz files "on the fly".

        * glpcli.h, glpcli.c
        Command-line interface routines were added. (This feature is
        incomplete so far.)

        Mathprog table driver for xBASE was added to the package.

        * glpmpl03.c
        A minor was fixed in the MathProg translator (if some field
        specified in the table statement is missing in corresponding
        input table, the bug causes abnormal termination). Thanks to
        Heinrich Schuchardt <heinrich.schuchardt@gmx.de> for the bug
        report.

        * glpmpl.h, glpmpl.c
        STRING data type was replaced by plain character strings.

        The principal change is upgrading to GPLv3.

        * glpapi01.c
        A serious bug in the routine glp_del_cols was fixed; thanks to
        Cedric[FR] <fox2113@wanadoo.fr> for the bug report. The bug
        appeared because on deleting non-basic columns the basis header
        remained valid, however, contained invalid (old) column ordinal
        numbers.

        * glpapi10.c
        A new advanced API routine glp_mem_limit was added.

Mon Feb 05 08:00:00 2007 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 4.14 has been released
        Now GLPK conforms to ILP32, LLP64, and LP64 programming models
        (the latter seems to be the ultimate choice regarding 64-bit
        architectures). Note that GLPK itself is a 32-bit application,
        and the conformity only means that the package works correctly
        on all these arenae. Nevertheless, on 64-bit platforms it is
        possible to use more than 4GB of memory, if necessary.

        * Makefile
        Starting from this release only the header glpk.h is needed to
        be installed.

        * glplib01.c
        Two routines bigmul and bigdiv which performs multiplication
        and division of unsigned integers of arbitrary precision were
        added.

        * glplib02.c
        A set of 64-bit arithmetic routines were added.

        * glplib04.c
        Some low-level library routines were improved and renamed.

        * glpcfg.h
        The macro GLP_TM_SPEC were introduced to specify a version of
        the time routine depending on the host environment.

Mon Nov 13 12:00:00 2006 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 4.13 has been released

        * configure.in
        '-lm' bug was fixed.

        * glpbfx.h, glpbfx.c
        Basis factorization interface routines based on exact (bignum)
        arithmetic were implemented.

        * glpssx.h, glpssx1.c, glpssx2.c
        Simplex method routines based on exact (bignum) arithmetic were
        implemented.

        exact simplex method, was added.

        * glpsol.c
        Two command-line options were added: '--exact' and '--xcheck'.

        * glpcfg.h
        The package configuration file was added.

        * glplib2.c
        Alternative version of the routines umalloc, ucalloc, and ufree
        was provided. It does not limit the amount of allocated memory
        to INT_MAX bytes and therefore can be used on platforms where
        sizeof(void *) > sizeof(int). To enable this version one should
        define the preprocessor variable GLP_HUGE_MEM.

        * glprng.c
        The routine rng_create_rand was changed to initialize the
        generator using seed = 1, not 0, to conform ISO C requirements.

        * glpgmp.h, glpgmp.c
        A set of bignum arithmetic routines implementing operations on
        integers and rationals was added. These routines are compatible
        with the GNU MP library.

        NOTE: To attain a much better performance it is recommended to
        use, if possible, the original GNU MP library rather than the
        GLPK version, by defining the preprocessor variable GLP_USE_GMP.

        * glplux.h, glplux.c
        A tentative implementation of sparse LU-factorization based on
        exact (bignum) arithmetic was added.

        A tentative implementation of some simplex method routines based
        on exact (bignum) arithmetic was added.

        * glplpx6f.c
        A preliminary implementation of the routine lpx_exact_check was
        added. This routine checks the current basis for primal and dual
        feasibility using exact (bignum) arithmetic.

        * examples/glpsol.c
        The command-line option '--xcheck' was introduced to check the
        current basis for feasibility using exact (bignum) arithmetic.

        however, additionally marks the column as integer).

        * include/glpbfi.h, src/glpbfi.c
        The module glpbfi which implements the basis factorization
        interface (BFI) was added.

        routines to maintain the conflict graph were added.

        * include/glplpx.h, src/glplpx5.c
        The routine lpx_cpx_basis implementing Bixby's algorithm to
        construct an initial LP basis was added.

        * examples/glpsol.c
        Command-line option '--bib' was added which allows building
        an initial LP basis using Bixby's algorithm.
        Default command-line option '--mps' was changed to '--freemps'.

        * examples/cf12a.mod, examples/cf12b.mod
        Two examples in MathProg (curve fitting problem) were added.
        Thanks to Dr. Harley Mackenzie <hjm@hardsoftware.com>.

        GLPK Java interface module was temporarily removed from the
        distribution due to licensing problems.

Wed Aug 04 12:00:00 2004 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 4.6 has been released.

        * glpmpl.h, glpmpl1.c, glpmpl2.c, glpmpl3.c, glpmpl4.c
        Three new statements were implemented in the GNU MathProg
        language: solve, printf, and for. Also some bugs were fixed.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx8e.c
        Two API routines were added: lpx_read_prob and lpx_write_prob,
        which allow reading and writing problem data in GNU LP format.

        * glpsol.c
        Three new command-line options were added: --glp (to read
        problem data in GNU LP format), --wglp (to write problem data
        in GNU LP format), and --name (to change problem name).

        * glprng.h, glprng.c
        A portable pseudo-random number generator was implemented as a
        separate module.

        * glplib4.c
        The old implementation of a pseudo-random number generator was
        removed from the package.

        * doc/lang.*, doc/refman.*
        New edition of the GLPK documentation was included.

        * contrib/glpkmex/*.*
        A new version of GLPKMEX was included in the distribution. For
        more details see contrib/glpkmex/ChangeLog.

Mon Jul 19 12:00:00 2004 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 4.5 has been released.

        * glpmip.h, glpmip1.c, glpmip2.c, glplpx6c.c
        New implementation of the branch-and-bound method was added.
        It replaces the old implementation, which was removed from the
        package.

        * glpies.h, glpies1.c, glpies2.c, glpies3.c
        Modules used in the old implementation of the branch-and-bound
        method were removed from the package.

        * glplib2.c
        Now if the preprocessor variable GLPHUGEMEM is defined, other
        version of the routines umalloc, ucalloc, and ufree is used on
        compiling the package. This allows avoiding memory allocation
        problems on platforms where sizeof(void *) > sizeof(int), for
        example, where addresses are 64-bit while integers are 32-bit.
        The modification was made due to a bug report provided by Karel
        Zimmermann <kzimm@diamant.jouy.inra.fr> and Christophe Caron
        <caron@diamant.jouy.inra.fr>.

Sat Jan 17 12:00:00 2004 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 4.4 has been released.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx*.c

        lpx_get_mip_obj        lpx_mip_obj_val

        Obsolete API routines were kept for backward compatibility,
        however, they will be removed in the future.

        * doc/refman.*
        New edition of the GLPK reference manual containing description
        of all new API routines was included.

        * contrib/glpkmex/*.*
        GLPKMEX, a Matlab MEX interface to GLPK package, contributed by
        Nicolo Giorgetti <giorgetti@dii.unisi.it> was included.

        * doc/GLPK_FAQ.txt
        GLPK FAQ contributed by Harley Mackenzie <hjm@bigpond.com> was
        included.

        Uniform, Normal01, Normal) were added to the MathProg language.

        * glpmpl1.c
        The MathProg syntax was changed to allow writing 'subj to'.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx1.c, glplpx2.c
        The new api routine lpx_get_ray_info was added.

        * glplpx8a.c
        The api routine lpx_print_sol was changed to print the number of
        non-basic variable, which causes primal unboundness.

        * glpmps.c
        The code was changed to avoid errors on compiling the package on
        Mac OS X. Thanks to Andre Girard <andre@inrs-emt.uquebec.ca> for
        the bug report.

        * doc/lang.*, doc/refman.*
        Several typos were fixed and some new material was added in the
        glpk documentation.

Fri Nov 14 12:00:00 2003 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 4.2 has been released.

        * glpiet.h, glpiet.c, glpios.h, glpios1.c, glpios2.c, glpios3.c
        A preliminary implementation of the Integer Optimization Suite
        (IOS) was included in the package. Eventually IOS will replace
        the Implicit Enumeration Suite (IES).

        * glplpx.h, glplpx6d.c
        A dummy version of the integer optimization routine lpx_intopt
        was included in the package. Later this routine will replace the
        routine lpx_integer.

        * examples/glpsol.c
        A new command-line option --int-opt was added to the solver to
        call lpx_intopt rather than lpx_integer.

        * glpbcs.h, glpbcs1.c, glpbcs2.c
        Being replaced by IOS routines (see above) the Branch-and-Cut
        Framework (BCS) routines were removed from the package.

        * examples/tspsol.c
        Stand-alone Symmetric TSP solver was completely re-programmed
        using IOS routines.

        * glplib.h, glplib2.c, glplib4.c
        The random-number generator was implemented. It is based on the
        module GB_FLIB from the Stanford GraphBase originally developed
        by Donald Knuth.

        * glphbsm.c, glplpx8a.c, glpmps.c
        All calls to fopen/fclose were replaced by corresponding calls
        to ufopen/ufclose due to bug reports provided by Morten Welinder
        <terra@gnu.org> and <jpark@sfwmd.gov>.

        * glpmps.c
        The code was made re-entrant.

        * glplpx8b.c
        API routine lpx_print_sens_bnds for bounds sensitivity analysis
        contributed by Brady Hunsaker <hunsaker@engr.pitt.edu> was added
        to the package. This feature is also available in glpsol via the
        command-line option --bounds.

        * contrib/jni/*.*
        New version of GLPK JNI (Java Native Interface) contributed by
        Chris Rosebrugh <cpr@pobox.com> was added to the package.

        * contrib/deli/*.*
        GLPK DELI (Delphi Interface) contributed by Ivo van Baren
        <i.van.baren@freeler.nl> was added to the package.

        * glplpx3.c
        Default method to scale the problem was changed to equilibration
        scaling (lp->scale = 1 in lpx_reset_parms).

        * glplpx6a.c
        Two minor (non-critical) typos were fixed due to report provided
        by Andrew Hamilton-Wright <andrewhw@ieee.org>.

        * glplpp2.c
        An untested case (line 941) had been tested due to bug report
        provided by Jiri Spitz <jiri.spitz@telecom.cz>.

        * w32bc5.mak, w32vc6.mak, w32vc6d.mak, d32dmc.mak
        Several makefiles were added to allow building GLPK library for
        some non-GNU 32-bit platforms.

Sat Aug 23 12:00:00 2003 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 4.1 has been released.

        * glpmpl1.c, glpmpl3.c
        Some bugs were fixed in the MathProg translator due to the bug
        reports provided by Giles Thompson <gwpt1@cus.cam.ac.uk>:
        conditional set expressions were incorrectly parsed;
        dimen attribute was not set by default when a set was used
        recursively in its own declaration;
        logical expressions ... in if ... then ... else ... did not
        work;
        displaying set expressions did not free memory allocated for
        temporary results.

        * glpmpl3.c (reduce_terms)
        Implementation of summation of linear forms over domain was
        improved to reduce complexity of that operation from O(n*n) to
        O(n*log n). The improvement was made due to a report provided
        by Sebastien de Menten <sdementen@hotmail.com>.

        * glplpx6a.c (line 1056), glpmip1.c (line 641)
        Two minor bugs were fixed due to the bug report provided by
        Kendall Demaree <kendal.demaree@verizon.net>.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx6a.c
        The method of one artificial variable implemented in the routine
        lpx_prim_art and used on the phase I in the glpk simplex solver
        has a serious defect: for some lp instances it erroneously
        reports that the problem has no primal feasible solution. This
        error appears when the column of the artificial variable, which
        enters the basis to make it primal feasible, has large
        constraint coefficients, that leads to small reduced costs of
        non-basic variables and premature termination of the search,
        i.e. to wrong conclusion that the problem has no primal feasible
        solution. To avoid this defect the routine lpx_prim_feas was
        included. It implements the method of implicit artifical
        variables (based on minimization of the sum of infeasibilities),
        which is a bit slower but much more robust. The routine
        lpx_prim_feas having the same functionality now is used instead
        the routine lpx_prim_art.

        * glpinv.h, glpinv.c
        The test used in the routine inv_update to detect low accuracy
        after updating LU-factorization of the basis matrix was replaced
        by a new, more robust test.

        * glplpx6c.c
        Selecting an active node to be solved next in the routine
        btrack_bestp was changed. Now, if any integer feasible solution
        has not been found yet, the routine chooses an active node which
        has the minimal sum of integer infeasibilities.

        * glpmip.h, glpmip1.c
        The additional flag int_obj was included in the structure
        MIPTREE used by the branch-and-bound. This flag is set in the
        routine mip_create_tree and used in the routine is_better. It
        means that the objective is integral, i.e. depends only on
        integer variables with integer objective coefficients. The test
        used in the routine check_integrality was also replaced by a
        new, more reasonable one.

        * glplpx1.c
        A minor bug was fixed in the routine lpx_check_name.

        * glpmpl.h, glpmpl4.c, glplpx8d.c
        The flag skip_data was added to the parameter list of the
        routine mpl_read_model. If this flag is set, the data section
        in the model file is ignored. Corresponding change was made in
        the routine lpx_read_model. Now, if both model and data files
        are specified, the data section in the model file is ignored.

        * glplpx8c.c
        A minor bug (wrong format used for writing free columns) in the
        routine lpx_write_lpt was fixed due to the bug report provided
        by Bernhard Schmidt <schmidt@math.uni-augsburg.de>

        * sample/glpsol.c
        The command-line parameter --tmlim, which allows limiting the
        solution time, was added.

        * doc/lang.*, doc/refman.*
        New edition of the GLPK documentation was included.

        * java-binding/*.*
        New version of the GLPK JNI (Java Native Interface) package was
        included in the distribution.

        * sample/lpglpk40.c
        A non-trivial example was added. It allows using GLPK as a base
        LP solver for Concorde, a program for solving Traveling Salesman
        Problem (TSP). For details see comments in lpglpk40.c.

        * sample/*.mod
        Some examples of LP and MIP models written in GNU MathProg were
        added.

Tue May 06 12:00:00 2003 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 4.0 has been released.

        * glpmpl.h, glpmpl1.c, glpmpl2.c, glpmpl3.c, glpmpl4.c
        The model translator for the GNU MathProg modeling language was
        implemented and included in the package.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx8d.c
        The api routine lpx_read_model, which is an interface to the
        MathProg translator, was included in the package.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx8a.c
        The api routine lpx_print_prob for writing LP/MIP problem data
        in plain text format was included in the package.

        * sample/glpsol.c
        New version of the GLPK stand-alone LP/MIP solver that supports
        the GNU MathProg modeling language was implemented.

        * doc/lang.latex, doc/lang.dvi, doc/lang.ps
        The document "GLPK: Modeling Language GNU MathProg" was included
        in the package.

        * doc/refman.latex, doc/refman.dvi, doc/refman.ps
        New edition of the GLPK Reference Manual was included in the
        package.

        * glplpx8c.c
        A bug in the api routine lpx_write_lpt was fixed. Due to that
        bug an addressing error occured in the routine if the objective
        function has the non-zero constant term.

        * glplan.h, glplan1.c, glplan2.c, glplan3.c, glplan4.c,
        * glplan5.c, glplan6.c, glplan7.c, glplan8.c, glplpx8b.c
        All modules of the translator for the GLPK/L modeling language
        were removed from the package, because GLPK/L being completely
        superseded by GNU MathProg is no more supported.

Tue Mar 25 12:00:00 2003 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.3 has been released.

        * glplpp.h, glplpp1.c, glplpp2.c
        An implementation of the built-in LP presolver was added to the
        package.

        * glplpx.h
        The flag presol was added to the structure LPX. This flag tells
        the lpx_simplex whether the built-in LP presolver should be used
        or not. By default this flag is off. Also three macros (namely
        LPX_E_NOPFS, LPX_E_NODFS, and LPX_K_PRESOL) that concern using
        the LP presolver were introduced.

        * glplpx3.c, glplpx6a.c
        These modules was changed to use the built-in LP presolver.

        * sample/glpsol.c
        Command line options --presol and --nopresol that concern using
        the LP presolver were added to the stand-alone LP/MIP solver.

        * glplan1.c
        This module was changed to allow declaring sets like A[1:10] in
        the models written in the GLPK/L modeling language.

        * doc/refman.latex, doc/lang.latex
        New editions of the documents "GLPK User's Guide" and "GLPK/L
        Modeling Language" were included in the distribution.

        * java-binding/*.*
        The package GLPK JNI (Java Native Interface) implementing Java
        binding for GLPK was included in the distribution. This package
        was developed and programmed by Yuri Victorovich <yuri@gjt.org>.

Tue Feb 18 12:00:00 2003 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.2.4 has been released.

        * glplpx6b.c
        The code was changed to allow auxiliary variables have non-zero
        objective coefficients.

        Also a minor bug was fixed (the constant term was not considered
        on displaying the objective function value).

        * sample/glpsol.c
        The code was changed to fix a bug (the command-line option 'bfs'
        was not recognized). The bug was fixed due to report provided by
        Olivier <odwl@skynet.be>.

        * glplpt.c
        The code was changed to fix a bug (binary variables were treated
        erroneously as integer ones).

        * glplpx6b.c
        The code was changed to fix a bug (variables that have no lower
        bounds were incorrectly processed on converting to the standard
        formulation). The bug was fixed due to report kindly provided by
        Kjell Eikland <kjell.eikland@broadpark.no>.

Mon Nov 11 12:00:00 2002 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.2.3 has been released.

        * glpmip.h, glpmip1.c
        A preliminary implementation of the branch-and-bound driver
        based on the implicit enumeration suite (glpies) was added to
        the package. This module is not documented yet.

        * glplpx6c.c
        A new implementation of the api routine lpx_integer which now
        is based on the b&b driver (see glpmip above) was included in
        the package. This new implementation has exactly the same
        functionality as the old version and therefore all changes are
        transparent to the api user.

        * glpbbm.h, glpbbm.c
        * glprsm.h, glprsm1.c, glprsm2.c
        * glplp.h, glplp.c
        These modules were removed from the package, because they were
        used only in the old version of the routine lpx_integer, which
        was replaced by the new version (see glplpx6c above).

        * glplpx.h, glplpx6a.c
        The api routine lpx_check_kkt was included in the package and
        its description was added in the reference manual. This routine
        allows checking Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions for an
        LP solution.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx8a.c
        Now the api routine lpx_print_sol also prints information about
        "solution quality" obtained via the api routine lpx_check_kkt.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx8a.c
        New api routines lpx_read_bas and lpx_write_bas were included
        in the package and documented. The routine lpx_write_bas allows
        writing a current basis from an LP object to a text file in the
        MPS format. The routine lpx_read_bas allows reading a basis
        prepared in the MPS format from a text file into an LP object.

        * glplpt.c
        The parsing routine which reads LP problem data prepared in the
        CPLEX LP format was modified to allow specifying lower bounds
        of variables also in the form 'variable >= lower bound' (in the
        bounds section). This modification was made due to a notice
        provided by Ivan Luzzi <iluzzi@libero.it>.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx8c.c
        The api routine lpx_write_lpt which allows writing LP problem
        data from an LP object to a text file using the CPLEX LP format
        was included in the package and documented.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx3.c
        The control parameter LPX_K_LPTORIG that affects the behavior
        of the api routine lpx_write_lpt was introduced.

        * glplan6.c
        The semantics of the language GLPK/L was changed to allow
        selection in case when not all mute letters of a predicate (the
        operand that follows the keyword 'where') are presented in a
        parameter (the operand that precedes the keyword 'where'), i.e.
        to allow writing something like this:
            y[j] := sum(i, x[i] where p[i,j]);
        The paragraph "Selection" in the langauge description (page 25)
        was also correspondingly changed. This change of the language
        semantics was undertaken due to a notice provided by Peter Lee
        <plee@kinggee.com.au>.

        * sample/hwd.lpm
        A nice example of LP model written in GLPK/L and contributed by
        Peter Lee <plee@kinggee.com.au> was included in the package.

        * glplpx6b.c
        The api routine lpx_interior was modified: a) to compute dual
        values for all structural as well as auxiliary variables; b) to
        allow specifying non-zero objective coefficients at auxiliary
        variables.

        * sample/glpsol.c
        Three new command-line options were added to the solver, which
        are: --plain, --orig, and --wrlpt.

Mon Oct 14 12:00:00 2002 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.2.2 has been released.

        * glplpt.h, glplpt.c
        A module that reads LP/MIP problem data in CPLEX LP format was
        implemented.

        * glplpx8c.c
        An api routine lpx_read_lpt that reads LP/MIP problem data in
        CPLEX LP format was implemented.

        * sample/glpsol.c, sample/plan.lpt
        A new command-line option '--lpt' that allows reading LP/MIP
        problem data in CPLEX LP format was added to the solver.

        * doc/refman.latex, doc/refman.dvi, doc/refman.ps
        A new edition of the Reference Manual was included.

        * source/*.c
        Casting to (unsigned char) was added in some calls to the
        classification functions (isalpha, etc.). The bug was fixed due
        to report provided by Morten Welinder <terra@diku.dk>.

        * glplpx8a.c
        The local routine mps_numb used in the routine lpx_write_mps
        was modified to correctly format floating-point numbers that
        have two digits in the decimal exponent. The bug was fixed due
        to report provided by Vlahos Kiriakos <Kiriakos.Vlahos@gs.com>.

        * glplan.h, glplan1.c, ..., glplan8.c
        Several serious bugs were fixed in the language processor due
        to reports provided by <NORBERT.PIOTROWSKI@LHSYSTEMS.COM>:
        (a) a static search tree used to find sparse array elements was
        sometimes overwritten that caused the message 'assertion failed'
        to appear; the bug was fixed by creating separate search trees
        in parsing routines; (b) a variable declared using the
        predicate-controlled variable declaration statement had wrong
        order of domain sets, because the variable array was built as
        a copy of the predicate array; the bug was fixed by using the
        internal routine transpose that coordinates mute letters (and
        therefore domain sets) on copying sparse arrays; (c) sometimes
        assignment statements like x[#a,#b,#c] := ... was incorrectly
        processed; the bug was fixed by including an appropriate check
        into the internal routine assign_stmt.

        * glp_simplex.c
        An additional check to see if all lower bounds are not greater
        than corresponding upper bounds was included in the routine to
        prevent wrong results to appear. Such incorrectness sometimes
        was not detected, namely, when variables with such bounds were
        non-basic and never entered the basis.

        * glpspx1.c
        Maximal number of simplex iterations before reinversion was
        decreased from 100 to 50. This allowed to improve accuracy and,
        that is more important, to reduce the solution time for many
        serial lp problems approximately 1.5--2 times.

        * glpspx2.c
        A check to see if all elements in the column chosen to enter
        the basis are close to zero in the routine spx_prim_chuzr was
        temporarily removed because this check gave wrong conclusion in
        case when the corresponding non-basic variable had zero column
        in the constraint matrix. An analogous check to see if all
        elements in the row chosen to leave the basis are close to zero
        in the routine spx_dual_chuzc was also temporarily removed on
        the same reason. The bug was fixed due to reports provided by
        Flavio Keidi Miyazawa <fkm@ic.unicamp.br> and Vlahos Kiriakos
        <Kiriakos.Vlahos@gs.com>.

        The identifier 'class' (used as a member name in the structure
        LPX and as an argument name in the routine lpx_set_class) was
        changed to 'clss' in order to avoid conflicts with C++ reserved
        words.

        * glpk.h, glplpx.h, glplpx1.c, glplpx2.c, glplpx6a.c,
        * glplpx6b.c, glplpx6c.c, glplpx7.c, glplpx8.c

        * glpapi.h, glpapi1.c, glpapi2.c, glpapi3.c, glpapi4.c
        These files (which contain old api routines) were removed from
        the package.

        * glpipm1.c, glpipm2.c
        The file glpipm1.c was renamed to glpipm.c. The file glpipm2.c
        was used only by old api routines and therefore was removed from
        the package.

        * language.texinfo
        Old version of the document "GLPK: Modeling Language GLPK/L" was
        removed from the distribution.

        'oldsrc').

        * glprsm.h
        Some declarations related to the module 'glprsm3.c' (see above)
        were removed.

        * guide.texinfo

        glp_simplex1, glp_pivot_in, glp_pivot_out) were removed from the
        package (to the subdirectory 'oldsrc') since these routines are
        functionally superseded by the new api routines.

        * glpk.h, glpapi2.c, glpapi3.c, glpapi4.c
        The api routines glp_simplex2, glp_call_ipm1, glp_call_bbm1 were

        simplex method and therefore they were removed from the package
        (however they still can be found in the subdirectory 'oldsrc').

        * glprsm1.c
        The routine crash_aa was replaced by a new implementation and
        therefore it was removed from the file 'glprsm1.c'.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx.c, glpspx.h, glpspx1.c, glpspx2.c, glpspx3.c,

        * glppfi.h, glppfi.c, glprfi.h, glprfi.c
        These routines implement some other forms of the basis matrix.
        Now they became obsolete being functionally superseded by the
        new version of basis maintenance routines (see above) and were
        removed from the package (however they still can be found in the
        subdirectory 'oldsrc').

        * glpbbm.c, glprsm.h, glprsm1.h, glprsm2.h, glpspx.h, glpspx2.c,
        * glprsm2.c, glpsol.c

Mon Dec 10 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.0.4 has been released.

        * glpspx.h, glpspx1.c, glpspx2.c, glpapi/glp_simplex2.h
        A new, more efficient version of the two-phase primal simplex
        method was implemented (advanced initial basis, projected
        steepest edge, recursive computations of solution components).

        * glpapi/glp_call_bbm1.c
        Now LP relaxation can be solved either using rsm1_driver(), or
        using glp_simplex2(). The choice is controlled by the parameter
        'meth' (a member of struct bbm1).

        * sample/glpsol.c
        The new implementation of the simplex method is now used by
        default. The old version is available via --old-sim option.

        * glpmat/gm_scaling.c
        Now this routine displays only two lines: an initial "quality"
        and a final "quality".

        * glplp/prepro_lp.c
        Identifiers 'fmin' and 'fmax' renamed to 'f_min' and 'f_max' in
        order to avoid conflict with <math.h>. The bug was fixed due to
        report provided by Sami Farin <sfarin@ratol.fi>.

Wed Oct 03 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.0.3 has been released.

        * glprsm/harris_row.c, glprsm/harris_col.c
        The relative tolerance used on the first pass of the two-pass
        ratio test was replaced by the absolute tolerance.

        * glprsm/rsm_primal.c, glprsm/rsm_feas.c, glprsm/rsm_dual.c
        The absolute tolerance passed to the two-pass ratio test routine
        was decaresed (for both primal and dual simplex).

        These changes were made in order to improve numerical stability
        of the simplex method.

        * glprsm/glp_call_rsm1.c, glprsm/glp_call_bbm1.c,
        * glprsm/glp_simplex1, glprsm/glp_pivoting.c
        Default form of the inverse was changed from RFI to AFI.

Mon Sep 24 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.0.2 has been released.

        * glpfhv.h, glpfhv.c
        New version of the basis maintaining routines was implemented.
        These routines, which are based on so called FHV-factorization
        (a variety of LU-factorization) and Gustavson's data structures,
        perform the main operations on the basis matrix faster at the
        expense of some worsening numerical accuracy.

        * glprsm.h, glprsm/afi.c
        The routines, which implement AFI (Advanced Form of the
        Inverse) based on FHV-factorization, were added to the package.
        This new form is available via the parameter form = 3 (on API
        level) or via the option --afi (in GLPSOL solver).

        * EFI was renamed to PFI
        In order to correct terminology the acronym EFI (Elimination
        Form of the Inverse) was replaced by PFI (Product Form of the
        Inverse) everywhere in the source code and the documentation.

        * glpset/umalloc.c, glpset/ucalloc.c
        * glpset/get_atom.c, glpset/get_atomv.c
        These memory management routines were changed in order *not* to
        clear allocated memory blocks by binary zeros.

Wed Aug 01 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.0.1 has been released.

        API routines was implemented.

        * glpapi/glp_set_row_fctr.c, glpapi/glp_set_col_fctr.c,
        * glpapi/glp_get_row_fctr.c, glpapi/glp_get_col_fctr.c,
        * glpapi/glp_scale_prob.c
        Scaling routines were added.

        * glpapi/glp_write_mps.c
        The routine for writing problem data in MPS format was added.

        * glpapi/glp_simplex1.c
        Comprehensive driver to the simplex method was added.

        * glpapi/glp_pivoting.c
        The routines glp_pivot_in() and glp_pivot_out() intended for
        basis maintaining were added.

        * glprsm/create_rsm.c, glprsm/delete_rsm.c, glprsm/scale_rsm.c,
        * glprsm/build_basis.c
        Additional low level routines related to the simplex method
        were added.

        * glpk.h, glpapi.h, glprsm.h
        Additional specifications for new routines and data structures
        were added.

        * sample/lpglpk30.c
        A non-trivial example was added. It allows using GLPK as a base
        LP solver for Concorde, a program for solving Traveling Salesman
        Problem (TSP). For details see comments in 'lpglpk30.c'.

        * doc/newapi.txt
        The document "Additional GLPK API Routines" that describes some
        new API routines was included.

Thu Jul 19 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.0 has been released.

        Now GLPK is provided with new API, which is intended for using
        the package in more complex algorithmic schemes.

        * glpapi/old_api.c
        All routines related to old API were gathered in one file named
        'old_api.c'.

        * glpapi/*.c
        These routines that implement new API were added to the package.

        * include/glpk.h, include/glpapi.h
        Specifications of new API routines and data structures were
        added to these headers. Specifications of old API routines and
        data structures were locked by #ifdef GLP_OLD_API directive.

        * doc/guide.texinfo
        New edition of the document "GLPK User's Guide" that correspond
        to new API was included.

        * GLPK 2.4.1 has been released.

        * doc/glpk_ml.texinfo
        The new document "Modeling Language GLPK/L" was included.

        * doc/glpk_ug.texinfo
        New edition of the document "GLPK User's Guide" was included.

        * doc/language.txt
        The preliminary document "GLPK/L Modeling Language: A Brief
        description" was removed from the distribution, because it has
        been replaced by the new document "Modeling Language GLPK/L".

        * glplang/l_spar.c
        The routine comparison() was re-programmed in order to
        implement the relation operation as specified in the language
        description.

        * glpmip.h, glpmip/*.c
        The partition 'glpmip' was renamed to 'glpbbm'.

Thu May 10 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 2.4 has been released.

        Now GLPK includes an implementation of a preliminary version of
        the GLPK/L modeling language.

        * glplang.h, glplang/*.c
        The header 'glplang.h' and a set of routines that implements
        the GLPK/L language processor (the partition 'glplang') were
        added to the package.

        * doc/language.txt
        The document "GLPK/L Modeling Language: A Brief Description
        (Supplement to GLPK User's Guide)" in plain text format was
        included in the package (see the file 'language.txt' in the
        subdirectory 'doc' of the distribution).

        * ex/model1.lpm, ex/model2.lpm
        Two examples of model descriptions written in GLPK/L were added
        to the package.

        * sample/glpsol.c
        This program was modified in order: a) to allow processing
        model description written in GLPK/L; b) to allow solving pure
        LP problem using the interior point method.

        * sample/glpipm.c
        This program was removed from the package, because its function
        was passed to the GLPSOL solver.

        * Makefile.in
        This file was changed in order to install the GLPSOL solver
        executable.

Mon Apr 09 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 2.3 has been released.

        * glpmip.h, glpmip/*.c
        These routines (that implement the branch-and-bound method) were
        re-programmed in order to improve robustness of implementation.
        In particular, heuristic routines were carried out from the main
        driver routine.

        Additional GLPK API routines were documented.

        New edition of the document "GLPK User's Guide" was included in
        the package.

        The preliminary document "Mixed Integer Programming Using GLPK
        Version 2.2 (Supplement to GLPK User's Guide)" was removed from
        the package, because this material was included in GLPK User's
        Guide.

Thu Mar 15 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 2.2 has been released.

        Now GLPK includes a tentative implementation of the
        branch-and-bound procedure based on the dual simplex method for
        mixed integer linear programming (MIP).

        The preliminary document "Mixed Integer Programming Using GLPK
        Version 2.2 (Supplement to GLPK User's Guide)" was included into
        the package in plain text format (see the file 'mip.txt' in the
        subdirectory 'doc' of the distribution).

        * glpmip.h, glpmip/*.c, glpapi/glp_integer.c
        These routines (that implement the branch-and-bound method) were
        added to the package.

        * sample/glpsol.c
        This program was modified in order to allow solving LP and MIP
        problems.

        * glprsm/rsm_primal.c, glprsm/rsm_dual.c, glprsm/rsm_feas.c,
        * glprsm/rsm1_driver.c
        These routines (which are drivers to basic components of the
        revised simplex method) were added to the package.

Mon Feb 19 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 2.1 has been released.

        * glprsm.h, glprsm/*.c
        These routines (that implement components of the revised simplex
        method) were re-programmed and documented.

        The document "GLPK Implementation of the Revised Simplex Method"
        was included into the package.

Thu Jan 25 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 2.0 has been released.

        Now GLPK includes a tentative implementation of the primal-dual
        interior point method for large-scale linear programming (for
        more details see the file `NEWS' in the distribution). A number
        of routines related to the interior point method were added to
        the package.

        * insist.c
        The routine `insist' and the macro of the same name were
        introduced into the package in order to replace the standard
        macro `assert'. Some routines require the expression specified
        in the `assert' macro to be evaluated, but compiling the package
        with NDEBUG option prevents from that. This bug was fixed due to
        bug report provided by Peter A. Huegler <phuegler@bsco.com>.

        * Makefile.in
        Minor bug was fixed due to a patch provided by Alexandre Oliva
        <oliva@lsd.ic.unicamp.br>.

Wed Jan 10 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 1.1.2 has been released.

        * umalloc.c, ufree.c, create_pool.c, get_atom.c, get_atomv.c
        These routines were changed in order to fix a bug due to
        report provided by Andrew Hood <ajhood@fl.net.au>. Because of
        this bug data alignment error occured on the Sparc computer.

Tue Dec 14 12:00:00 2000 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 1.1.1 has been released.

        Minor bug was fixed in `Makefile.in'.

        GLPK Library Reference was included.
