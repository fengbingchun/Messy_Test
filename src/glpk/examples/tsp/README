This subdirectory contains an example application program, TSPSOL,
which is a stand-alone solver intended to solve the Symmetric Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) with the GLPK integer optimizer.

Please note that this program is only an illustrative example that
illustrates generating "lazy" constraints during the branch-and-bound
search. It is *not* a state-of-the-art code, so only small-sized TSP
instances (perhaps, having up to 150-200 nodes) can be solved with this
program in a reasonable time. For more details see comments in the
source code.

To build TSPSOL executable you need to run 'build.sh' script. Note that
you should have the GLPK library properly installed.

To run the TSPSOL program use the following command:

      tspsol tsp-file

where tsp-file specifies an input text file containing TSP data in
TSPLIB 95 format.

Detailed description of the input format recognized by TSPSOL is given
in the report: Gerhard Reinelt, "TSPLIB 95". This report as well as
TSPLIB, a library of sample TSP instances, are freely available for
research purposes; see:
<http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/comopt/software/TSPLIB95/>.

This subdirectory also includes the following example TSP instances:

dantzig42.tsp  42 cities (Dantzig) [from TSPLIB]
gr120.tsp      120 cities in Germany (Groetschel) [from TSPLIB]
moscow.tsp     68 cities in Moscow region (Makhorin)
sample.tsp     small example from D.Phillips and A.Garcia-Diaz
ulysses16.tsp  Odyssey of Ulysses (Groetschel/Padberg) [from TSPLIB]
ulysses22.tsp  Odyssey of Ulysses (Groetschel/Padberg) [from TSPLIB]
