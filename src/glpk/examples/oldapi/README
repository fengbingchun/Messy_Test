The program module in this subdirectory contains an implementation of
the old GLPK API as it was defined in GLPK 4.48.

To compile an existing project using the old GLPK API you need to add
to the project two files lpx.h and lpx.c.

Please note that you may mix calls to old and new GLPK API routines in
the same project (except calls to glp_create_prob and glp_delete_prob).

The file lpxsamp.c is an example that illustrates using the old GLPK
API routines.
