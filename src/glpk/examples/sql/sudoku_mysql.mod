/* SUDOKU, Number Placement Puzzle */

/* Written in GNU MathProg by Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru> */

/* This example shows how to use the table statement.
   The sudoku to be solves is read from file sudoku_in.csv.
   The solution is written to sudoku_out.csv.

/* Sudoku, also known as Number Place, is a logic-based placement
   puzzle. The aim of the canonical puzzle is to enter a numerical
   digit from 1 through 9 in each cell of a 9x9 grid made up of 3x3
   subgrids (called "regions"), starting with various digits given in
   some cells (the "givens"). Each row, column, and region must contain
   only one instance of each numeral.

   Example:

   +-------+-------+-------+
   | 5 3 . | . 7 . | . . . |
   | 6 . . | 1 9 5 | . . . |
   | . 9 8 | . . . | . 6 . |
   +-------+-------+-------+
   | 8 . . | . 6 . | . . 3 |
   | 4 . . | 8 . 3 | . . 1 |
   | 7 . . | . 2 . | . . 6 |
   +-------+-------+-------+
   | . 6 . | . . . | 2 8 . |
   | . . . | 4 1 9 | . . 5 |
   | . . . | . 8 . | . 7 9 |
   +-------+-------+-------+
