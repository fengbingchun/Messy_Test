//  The Tree Template Class
//
//    This data structure is the internal data structure behind the lightweight
//    STL-like container classes. This is a red-black tree which provides for
//    fast insert, find, and erase operations.
//
//    The binary tree nodes are overlaid on top of larger chunks of allocated
//    memory (called chunks) which are arranged in a simple linked list. This
//    allows the tree to grow (add nodes) dynamically without incurring a heap
//    hit each time a new node is added.
//
//    The Tree class provides member functions which make it easily adaptable to
//    an STL-like interface so that it can be used as the backend for STL-like
//    container classes.
